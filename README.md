Linux only currently.

I am rendering a textured plane whos normal is the z axis, with the camera
looking right at it. Also i want to able to "pan" the camera left-right and
up-down "over" the plane.

But for some reason the plane is not visible at startup, only when panning the
camera i can get it into view. I can't figure out what i'm doing wrong.
